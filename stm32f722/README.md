# stm32f722

It also works with the following STM32F7 series.   
- STM32F722
- STM32F723

I used [this](https://github.com/seeers/CAN-Bus-Arduino_Core_STM32) as a reference.

# Changes from the original

- frame format   
This example support Extended frame format: with 29 identifier bits.   

- CAN port   
In this example, you can select the CAN port.   


# Remap CAN port
STM32F722/723 has one CAN ports.   
These GPIOs can be used as CAN.   
|CAN|RX|TX||
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|CAN1|PA11|PA12||
|CAN1|PB8|PB9||
|CAN1|PD0|PD1||
|CAN1|PH13|PH14|Not supported|

CAN1_RX mapped to PA11, CAN1_TX mapped to PA12   
```
CANInit(CAN_1000KBPS, 0);  // CAN_RX mapped to PA11, CAN_TX mapped to PA12
```

CAN1_RX mapped to PB8 , CAN1_TX mapped to PB9   
```
CANInit(CAN_1000KBPS, 2);  // CAN_RX mapped to PB8, CAN_TX mapped to PB9
```

CAN1_RX mapped to PD0 , CAN1_TX mapped to PD1   
```
CANInit(CAN_1000KBPS, 3);  // CAN_RX mapped to PD0, CAN_TX mapped to PD1
```
